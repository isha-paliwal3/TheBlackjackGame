            <b>Beat The Dealer.</b> Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible,
            without going over 21.


            <h2>Card Values/Scoring</h2>
            An ace is worth 1, Face cards: Jack=11, Queen=12, King=13 and any other card is its pip value.

            <h2>The User's Play</h2>
            The player goes first and must hit atleast once and then decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another
            card) or
            "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a
            player may stand on the first cards dealt to them, or they may hit and get additional cards, one at a time,
            until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the
            latter
            case, the player may lose or end up in a draw depending on dealer's score.

            <h2>The Dealer's Play</h2>
            Once the player clicks the stand button the dealer's card turns randomly and if the total is 17 or more, it
            must
            stand. If dealer's score mathes the player's score its a draw, if the score is less than the player the
            player
            wins otherwise the player loses.

            <h2>The Deal</h2>
            Once the result for a round is displayed player may seek for another round and may click the "Deal" button
            in
            order to reset the table.

            <h2>Scoreboard</h2>
            The total number of wins, draws and loses are updated in a scoreboard below the hit,stand and deal button.
